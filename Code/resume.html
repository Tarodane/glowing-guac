                      I have been Tyler Brown’s English teacher, and speech and debate coach for three years now.   Currently, I am his Speech and debate coach.   I have enjoyed having Tyler on the team and I have enjoyed having Tyler in English class.  He has a great sense of humor and a great sense of what it means to work in a team.  He has strong language and communication skills, and he is very organized in planning for long term and short term projects.   He also enjoys his participation in interpretive and in improvisational activities, as well as in debate.   His critical thinking skills are very strong, which will lead him to whatever challenges lie ahead of him.   Finally, he has strong technological skills which further can advance him in many job and team situations.  Above all, he has a strong sense of morality and a strong sense of boundaries which give him the sense of what is right and what is wrong.  I have seen this part of him develop over the three years that I have known him.  Please consider Tyler Brown for this opportunity.

                        I would like to take this opportunity to enthusiastically recommend Tyler Brown. As Tyler’s Academic Decathlon coach this year, I have had a chance to witness his work first hand. <br> From the first day of class, Tyler has shown a consistent desire to better understand the world around him. Through the course of the class, he has consistently not only done the required coursework, but also looked beyond the material to form a larger understanding. It is refreshing to find that quality in a high school student. <br> Tyler was also active in many other endeavors outside the classroom, like Academic Decathlon, or other activities like forensics, that never negatively impacted his studied. Quite the opposite, he makes every effort to stay ahead in class, so as to give him the freedom to pursue various extracurricular activities without hesitation. <br>
                        Academic Decathlon was an extremely demanding activity. The competition involves mastery of 10 different subjects ranging from basic  topics like Math and Lang/Lit to subjective competitions like Speech and Interview. Based on an application and interview, I personally selected him to be part of the team.
                        Finally, what stands out the most about Tyler is his positive, enthusiastic attitude about learning in general, and his constant drive to apply the knowledge he acquires. Tyler is someone who had both an excellent work ethic and innovative creativity that I place a high value on. I believe that he would be well suited to any academic environment.
