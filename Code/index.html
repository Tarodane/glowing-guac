            <h2>"Who Am I?"</h2>
            <p>
	        Well, for starters, I’m Tyler Brown, and I go to Bullard High School in Fresno California. My name is very common name, I know. Chances are, you know someone, or at least know of someone, who has that first name and/or that last name. However now, you know someone who has both: me, Tyler Brown, a speaker, gamer, baker, and someone pretty involved in church. My life, for the most part, revolves around doing those few things, but I put most of my focus into them.

           <h3>Technology</h3>
            <p>Technology, gaming, and computers: they're why I made this, it’s because of those things that you’re reading this. Gaming has gotten me into the world of technology and technological advances, intriguing me in a way that a lot of other things don’t. I love the idea of the next big thing to entertain, and what will help things like medicine or help students learn. I love the idea of going to a school where most of the time is spent at the computer, but still with other students face to face (which is how I spend half my school day). I love coming to my school away from my school (Called CART, Center for Advanced Research and Technology) and learning how to code and develop websites like this one and just make things look and feel fun and interactive. It’s great!

           <h3>Speaking</h3>
            <p>Speaking. I’m in my school’s forensics speech and debate class, which has taught me a lot. It’s also sort of helped out my drive to be better at things in general. I have this idea from somewhere that there is always another person to learn off of and to learn from, and that makes me listen to others and take mental notes and learn. From this, I’ve managed to be able to compete on a state level. Looking into it from the outside, there may not seem like much to speaking, but I swear that there are so many tiny details that one never notices until they actually start trying, and those tiny differences in a speech make a huge impact on the audience. This year, I’d like to get to nationals, but we’ll see how that goes.

           <h3>Religion</h3>
            <p>An important aspect about my is my religion: Christianity (specifically protestantism). The choices I make now sort of set my path for the rest of my life, so all the more reason to find a set of morals and beliefs right here and now. Even if people don’t believe as I do, I find that my religion in particular shows me a good way to live my life, and how I should focus my attention. After reading the entire Bible, I’ve gotten the idea of “Motion” from it, which helps fuel my constant desire to get better at things, learning from others and just motivating myself to continue in the things I love. I don’t regret my belief system, others may look down on it but, hey, at least I have a steadfast way to act. I’m even a leader in the “Fellowship of christian Athletes” club at my school, and I’ve given sermons to the middle schoolers at my church. A lot revolves around this too.

           <h3>Baking</h3>
            <p>Baking is one of the more past-timey things I do, but I still love learning about it. My favorite thing would definitely be making pancakes, but I sometimes bake and decorate cakes and cupcakes for small club meetings. On top of that, cooking is also something that I like doing. Everyone in my house has the tendency to make something edible, and I followed suit without question. I’m often surprised that many people don’t know how to bake or cook, because it mostly came natural to me. It’s just fun and a great learning experience. Heck, I’ve become more vulgar from how much Gordon Ramsay I’ve watched, I just love learning about this.
